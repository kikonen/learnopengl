source=33350 type=33361 id=131204 severity=37192 lenth=157 message=
Texture state usage warning: The texture object (0) bound to texture image unit 28 does not have a defined base level and cannot be used for texture mapping.

2)
Program undefined behavior warning: 
The current GL state uses a sampler (0) that has depth comparisons enabled, with a texture object (3) with a depth format, 
by a shader that samples it with a non-shadow sampler. 
Using this state to sample would result in undefined behavior
